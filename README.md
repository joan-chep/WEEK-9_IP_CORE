#### By **{Joan Chepkwony}**
## Description
{
In the Titanic dataset we are Implementing K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and a Naive Bayes classifier in our datasets.
In the spam datasets we are creating a model using the Naive Bayes Classifier that can predict whether an email is spam or not.
}
